# Bass Militia Website [Project name and one or two lines of overview]

A website built for the Bass Militia Collective, created to serve as a promotional showcase and contact directive for their music events team, as well as their freshly launched record label.
 
## UX [Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.]

Bass Militia is a Bristol based collective that focuses on creating and promoting electronic dance music - namely the harder and darker side of 4x4 bassline and mutant bass. They have been heavily involved in the local events industry for the past year in Bristol, having organised and successfully ran some of the best nights for this style of music in years.

The owner of the brand approached me and asked if I could build them a simple but effective website to serve some of their requirements and streamline their marketing. The initial request was to have a page that easily displayed contact information and all posters of the previous events organised by the brand, allowing them to easily present their back catalogue of work as well as a means of contact for anybody interested. I suggested they should also include event imagery as to deliver an instant insight on the general attendance and successful appearance of these past events.

I was told that in the past two months, the further expansion of the brand has led to the formation of a record label with the aim to push the music that has come to be expected when attending the events. When speaking with the client, we spoke about the fact they only planned to promote and display their full music catalogue on Soundcloud - a free music streaming website - and whilst this site does serve its purpose extremely well, it is not the best option for those wanting to uniquely display announcements and release information. It was also discussed how Facebook limits promotion of posts, and that when customers look on a businesses Facebook page, they don't gain a very good grasp of the company whereas a website allows you to immediately be faced with the information in a unique style.

So the basis of this project was to provide the client with a platform to document and showcase their content. I explained that I could create a front end site that would do just this.


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.


(User stories bit)

As somebody that has heard of Bass Militia, I want to look at the previous events organised by the brand so that I can see if its something I would be interested in.

As a promoter looking to potentially collaborate, I want to look at what the brand has done in the past and then have the ability to contact them.

As an existing fan of Bass Militia or as somebody that has previously attended one of their events, I want to be able to look on their website and see any upcoming events, this way I can see the dates of them and see what acts will be playing.

As a DJ, I want to look up the music catalogue offered by the record label so that I can efficiently see what has been released and what is forthcoming.

As a producer, I want to be able to see what has been previously released and have the ability to contact them, this way I can see if my own music will fit the style and if it would be something they are interested in.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

- record label page
- events page
- merch page
- contact page

 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
